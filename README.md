VAERS Covid-19 Vax Symptom Data Organized

*** Not interested in making this political, I just know a decent dataset when I see one ***

If you are new to data science, and would like to see an example of organizing large data sets using pandas, check out this relatively simple script I wrote using the publicly available VAERS dataset.

The final product of this script is a pandas  data frame containing over 500k unique Covid-19 vaccination symptom reports. Each case includes a relatively extensive patient profile, and their reported symptoms.
